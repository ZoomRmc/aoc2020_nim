# aoc2020_nim
AOC 2020 in Nim

## General notes
What I'm trying to stick to while writing the solutions, in order of importance:
 - Intelligible implementation logic, clear data flow
 - Brevity must not hurt readability
 - Short, self-sustaining functions with evident behaviour, hopefully as "strict" as reasonable
 - Keep the solutions for both parts of the task separated (one should work in case the other was removed from the code), extract repeating computations to functions/templates
 - Use the more suitable data structures available (it's tempting and boring to solve *everything* with Hash Tables)
 - Explore standard library before jumping to external libs

## Notes on specific days
**Spoilers below!**

### Day 25
Basic crypto. If you're afraid of Part 2 while solving the first - don't!

### Day 24
If you rely on properly parsing into the appropriate types and implement the basic operations, the rest is easy.

### Day 23
Linked lists/rings are unsurprisingly slow (nice to have all the available versions in std, though). Using an array as a substitute works great, even though you need to be careful with all the indexing. Managed to cut my initial "stream of consciousness" implementation by more than a third on a cleaning-up pass - as usual, turns out you need much fewer temporary variables than you'd think!

### Day 22
If you prepare the main logic right, solving the second part is easy via some tracking with a `HasSet` where the game's score serves as a key.

### Day 21
The day when I expected to need the whole information on the ingredients right from the start, so I didn't make a specific solution for Part 1. `std/sets` help *a lot*. Just a bunch of iterative exclusions and intersections. Straightforward and thus satisfying.

### Day 22
This was an easy one for me. Again, surprised to see some bright minds having some complications here. Nothing more than just reading the specifications and implementing it. And I have to say, we'd live in an utopian future by now if everyone could write the specs so good.

### Day 20
If I find a solution which is at the very least a little bit pleasant, I'll let you know.

### Day 19
Solved the first part with `pegs` and had to rewrite it all with `nre`, since pegs in std don't support recursion.

### Day 18
Finally rewritten using the somewhat clunky `eventParser` macro from `std/pegs`. The first part is easy, as we can eval right-to-left, the second one is too, as soon as you remember about the commutative properties of multiplication and treat a sum as a parenthesized one, in other words: multiply right to left, remember the product, multiply each term of a sum you meet by the product. Let the `pegs` deal with parenthesis.

### Day 17:
Game of Life in 3 and 4 dimensions, no twist. Nope, I wasn't going to treat *edge* cases this time just allotting extra cells on the edges of dimensions and skipping them when scanning in loops. Not feeling too enthusiastic by this point, so no generalized code, just copypasted the solution for Part 1 for Part 2.

### Day 16:
Wasted some time after I got the correct result (sets of possible fields for each position in a ticket) but expected to not need the final elimination so I hunted for an error that wasn't there. The fact that the input data has to be fitted so the results of filtering are unambiguous hints that this particular task doesn't have an elegant and truly satisfying solution. 

### Day 15:
[Van Eck sequence](https://oeis.org/A181391), nothing fancy, though I opted for a mutating iterator here. Could be sped-up with a sequence instead of a table, but the speed of a naÃ¯ve solution is still reasonable.

A sequence can be used in two ways:
    - As a substitute for a table: Max N in a sequence is never > round it appeared last, so length of the sequence equal to the number of rounds can store all possible values.
    - Sequential memory, which requires scanning it backwards, but mostly not far, so it's still fast.

Haven't tried to compare the speed of these approaches yet.

### Day 14:
This took me more time than I was comfortable with, since the solution required a bit of parsing and then a lot of monitoring for off-by-one, bit order and logical bitwise operation correctness. The main idea for permutation in Part 2 is keeping the indexes of "floating" bits, incrementing a number `i` up to 2^(number of floating bits) and setting each floating bit to a corresponding bit of `i`. 

This is probably the first time I ended up with the amount of boilerplate code which is a bit larger than justified by complexity of the task.

### Day 13:
When you see only prime numbers in input and test data you know there's a twist. Tried to come up with a solution without looking for any existing algos, so no CRT here. Accumulation and growing an increment (`jump` in the code) is certainly good enough for the task and almost instant.

### Day 12:
Pretty pleased with my solution, enum ordering + modulo arithmetic fit nicely, wonder if it's the intended way to approach the task. Writing the solution was too smooth: coded in the rotation around a point before reading it's always around `0,0`. Again, Eric went easy on us, so only quarter-turn angles = no trigonometry involved. Left out 2 approaches to CCW turns, not sure which one is better.

### Day 11:
Just counting indexes. Tedious and not much rewarding. Nim's std doesn't help much with anything 2D, so wrote a couple of iterators for `aocutils.nim` just in case. General technique of surrounding the matrix with empty cells could simplify working the edges/corners, but not necessary this time.

Spent more time separating code into logical chunks, but can't say the resulting template and surrounding functions are a work of art. Pretty *meh* task overall, at least printing matrix to stdout looks cool.

### Day 10:
It's tempting to just throw a bunch of resources to brute-force it, and, surprisingly, that's what a lot of people did, not too successfully. A couple of minutes with pen and paper pays off.

### Day 9:
Basic algo, no surprises, double-ended queue and a bunch of `IntSet`s. Thank heavens we search for a *contiguous* set in P2.

### Day 8:
Surprisingly not hard, as the "program" runs sequentially without any branching, so simple counting works for loop detection. Dumb backtracking and flipping `jmp`s and `nop`s.

### Day 7:
I don't like recursive solutions, but this task is not worth growing a forest over.
Part 2: On the first run I expectedly forgot multiplication. Please, nod to your screen if you did too.

### Day 6:
The second time the input is presented as a bunch of lines separated by a blank one: time to write an iterator for `aocutils`. Nim doesn't allow to attach to native `lines` iter, so the easiest thing is to resort to collecting in an intermediate sequence. Nasty.

zero-functional maps and folds (as well as std's `mapIt` and such) feel a bit clumsy with their 'a's and 'it's instead of just taking closures, thus again have to insert `block`s inside fold() parens.

### Day 5:
In Part 2 we know the numbers are continuous except one, so `xor` it is.

### Day 4:
Initial solution for the Part 1 used parsing named enums, storing them in an `IntSet` and comparing the set with the full one, but I knew from the start I'll need to parse it all in the Part 2. PEGs to the rescue, although, [docs](https://nim-lang.org/docs/pegs.html) are on the speccy side and rather sparse, so had to do lots of experimenting.

### Day 3:
[zero_functional](https://github.com/zero-functional/zero-functional) turned out not ergonomic *enough* here, so had to use `countup` and indexing, instead of iterating over items and enumerating pre- and post- filter.
